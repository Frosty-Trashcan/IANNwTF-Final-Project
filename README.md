# IANNwTF-Final-Project
Repository for the final IANNwTF Project
By Michael Rau and Marc Zeller

This Repo includes the scripts/implementation of our project, the data to be used, the project report and the video presentation (in .wvm format), and the logs of our model's performance in .v2 file format.
To replicate: Run the Preprocessing script in the root folder of the data, and load the resulting preprocessed datasets with the main script.
