# IANNwTF-Final-Project
Repository for the final IANNwTF Project
By Michael Rau and Marc Zeller

This Repo includes the scripts/implementation of our project, the data to be used provided in a zip file (provided via Google Drive Link), the project report and the video presentation, and the logs of our model's performance in .v2 file format.

To replicate: Run the Preprocessing script in the root folder of the data, and load the resulting preprocessed datasets with the main script.

The Data can be found here:
